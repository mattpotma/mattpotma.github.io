  <p>That&#39;s a great question. Hopefully, by the end of my trip, I&#39;ll be able to answer it.</p>

<p>I should start off with a bit of context, going back nearly 6 years now.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="http://mattpotma.github.io/assets/matt-grace.jpg" style="width: 350px;"/></p>

<p>My wife, Grace, is a very passionate person, and the passion of hers which tops all others is her need to help people. When we first began dating; and this is truly the beginning, before she would allow me to say we were dating, she asked me if I would be willing to move to Africa with her for 5 years. She had recently returned from a travel study in Zambia, so this topic was quite fresh in her mind, and she certainly couldn&#39;t date anyone not willing to share this part of her life.</p>

<p>As best as I can recall, my response was that &quot;I&#39;m not opposed to the idea, but it would certainly require some discussion.&quot; That was enough for her.</p>

<p>Fast froward a few years, skipping over a few details, now an old married couple of a little more than 3 years, and Grace called me out on that. Not necessarily a 5 year trip to Africa, but something to get our feet wet.</p>

<p>After a long search, Grace became connected with an organization in Eldoret, Kenya, called AMPATH, who is a &quot;a partnership between Moi University, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, North American universities led by Indiana University, and the Kenyan Government. Together, [they] work to build holistic, sustainable health in Kenya and around the world.&quot; <a href="https://www.ampathkenya.org/">1</a> Her position with AMPATH, as a Product Management Consultant for a software development team building a medical records system, is a great use of both her medical background (Registered Nurse), and her current professional experience (MBA working for a Healthcare Software Startup company).</p>

None of that actually says what <em>I</em> am doing here though.</p>

<p>For my 9-to-5 of sorts, I&#39;m working for a Canadian company, doing machine learning stuff. We&#39;re applying deep learning to audio to try to build a better hearing aid. This job allows me to work anywhere in the world, as long as I have an internet connection. It also happens to be a very interesting problem!</p>

<p>With the rest of my time here, I want to figure out what role I can play in reducing the inequalities of both income and power throughout the world.</p>

<p>I hope to get away from the charity model, where someone from a high income country simply sends money for whatever amenity or infrastructure they believe is most necessary. Instead, my hope is that I can simply assist the locals, helping to bridge whatever is holding them back from success.</p>

<p>So far, my knowledge of machine learning seems to be a desirable skill. There are a few different projects related to machine learning which I&#39;ll likely be consulting with, but I&#39;ll save that until I have something concrete to talk about.</p>

<p>Whether or not I can be of much help to them is yet to be determined. Answering that question is the reason I&#39;m here.</p>
